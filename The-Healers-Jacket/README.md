# The Healer's Jacket
Spellcaster's Jacket for Healers

## Contributor Information:
Credits go to N'ananère for giving me permission to use TERA - The Spellcaster for this outfit swap and to Wonton#2064 for helping fix the broken areas of the mod.

## Author's Comments:
This mods takes The Spellcaster's Jacket from The Spellcaster mod set by N'ananère and applies it to the Scion Healer's Robe.

Screenshot is from TERA - The Spellcaster as I haven't had a chance to replace the old screenshot [or take a better one for that matter].
