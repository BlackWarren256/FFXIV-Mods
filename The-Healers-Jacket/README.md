# The Healer's Jacket
Spellcaster's Jacket for Healers

## Details
This mods takes The Spellcaster's Jacket from The Spellcaster mod set by N'ananère and applies it to the Scion Healer's Robe. Some issues in patterns are there, however I'm hoping to get those dealt with eventually. I'm simply a bit new to making mods and this one was a trick to swap over, lol.

## Tool(s) Needed
